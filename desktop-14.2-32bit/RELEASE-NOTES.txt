Introduction
------------

The Microlinux Enterprise Desktop is a full-blown production desktop based on
Slackware Linux and the Xfce desktop environment, with many enhancements. It
is currently used by various small town halls, public libraries, schools and
local radio stations in South France.

MLED is not some derivative Linux distribution. It aims to provide all the
stuff that's commonly missing in Slackware - popular applications, multimedia
codecs, plugins, fonts, translations - through a series of package
repositories that can be easily managed through Slackware's package manager.
These package sets are installed on top of a trimmed-down but otherwise mostly
unaltered Slackware base system. A handful of stock Slackware packages have
been rebuilt for enhanced functionality. Elegant and sober artwork fit for use
in a corporate environment is included.

The first avatar of this project, dating back to 2006, was called "Slick
Linux" at the time and was based on Slackware 12.0 and Xfce 4.4. Over the
years, the project has undergone a few respins based on various desktop
environments. Since version 14.1, MLED is firmly based on Slackware and Xfce.
