libwebp:
libwebp: WebP is a method of lossy compression that can be used on
libwebp: photographic images. The degree of compression is adjustable so a
libwebp: user can choose the trade-off between file size and image quality.
libwebp: WebP typically achieves an average of 39% more compression than
libwebp: JPEG and JPEG 2000, without loss of image quality.
