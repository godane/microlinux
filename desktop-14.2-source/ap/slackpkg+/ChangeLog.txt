pkg/slackpkg+-1.7.0-noarch-1mt.txz: Upgraded
  After an huge work from community, we release the new slackpkg+ 1.7; so as
  everytime :), a big thanks goes to phenixia2003 that wrote most new code.
  We tried to release a more stable and improved version.
  slackpkg+ 1.7 adds new features with some new entries in configuration file
  that you should merge in your old slackpkgplus.conf:
    SEARCH_CLOG_INPARENT , WW_FILE_SEARCH , DETAILED_INFO , STRICTGPG
  see README for details.
  New features:
  - Now slackpkg+ allow you to see the ChangeLog in dialogbox.
  - Now 'info' command allow you to see more details for the packages.
  - Now slackpkg+ uses a Strict GPG Check.
  Improvements:
  - Quick output for Cached Download for a most clear output.
  - Improved performance for huge package lists.
  - Graylist works in remove and clean-system.
  - 'search' command is faster, looks for dir:/ repositories too, shows packages
    from all repositories (duplicated included), sort it by status and colors
    the output, and the 'file-search' command now can find substrings.
  - Cached Download works with check-updates too.
  - Reinstall command allow to select repository name when two repositories
    contains the same package.
  And many other BugFix or small things. See 'CHANGES' in documentation for a
  full list.

  new features, but it was done a large work of bugfixes and improvements.
  A special thanks is for phenixia2003 and yars068 for code contributing and
  for many other for ideas and testing. It's the time for the tests, to find
  for bugs or someother improvement.

    so it also impact remove and clean-system actions.
  - Improved performance searching packages and preparing the package list in
    large install/upgrade.
  - Improved 'slackpkg search' that now shows all packages matching from all
    repositories, not just that in priority; it will mark as 'masked' the
    packages that would not selected in install/upgrade mode. Also always show
    repository source for official packages.

Version 1.7.a1 - 04/Jan/2016
  It's the time for a stable version of slackpkg+. Currently it is just a
  development version to fix older feature and add/test new. I'll need more
  test possible to make it bugfree ;).

  - BugFix: slackpkg did give 'grep: write error' when running with "sudo su -".
  - Added repositories; improved checkrepos.sh
  - Strict GPG Check: Packages and metadata in one repository should be signed
