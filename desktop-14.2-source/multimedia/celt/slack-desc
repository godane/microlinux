celt: celt (low delay audio codec)
celt:
celt: CELT is a very low delay audio codec designed for high-quality
celt: communications. Traditional full-bandwidth  codecs such as Vorbis and
celt: AAC can offer high quality but they require codec delays of hundreds
celt: of milliseconds, which makes them unsuitable  for real-time
celt: interactive applications like teleconferencing. Speech targeted
celt: codecs, such as Speex or G.722, have lower 20-40ms delays but their
celt: speech focus and limited sampling rates restricts their quality,
celt: especially for music.
